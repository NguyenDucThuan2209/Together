## Together
* A fun and challenging number puzzle game that is perfect for anyone who loves puzzles
* The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible by placing numbered tiles on a grid
* When three or more tiles of the same number are placed next to each other, they merge into a new tile with a larger number
* The game ends when the grid is filled up, so players must carefully plan their moves to avoid filling up the grid too quickly
